Semantic Version History (SemVer)

v1.0.0 — D3 release
- Google Java Style compliance (Checkstyle clean).
- Debugging evidence with JDB (breakpoints in parseInput and computeSinh; step/print).
- Static code analysis via SonarCloud (dashboard + issues list captured).
- Accessibility improvements: accessible descriptions, label association (setLabelFor),
  mnemonic on Compute, default button, tooltips.
- Semantic Versioning adopted; GUI title shows v1.0.0; VERSION.txt added.
- Unit tests with JUnit 5 (green across test suite).
- Repository cleanup and structure: D3/src, D3/tests, docs/screenshots, tools (local only);
  updated .gitignore; D3 README with run/test instructions.

v0.9.0 — D2 release
- Re-implemented function from scratch in Java with a Swing GUI (no library shortcuts;
  only I/O, arithmetic, and UI APIs permitted).
- Custom power() and factorial() implementations; sinh(x) via Taylor series.
- Helpful exception handling with InvalidInputException and user-friendly messages.
- Persona created for target user.
- Requirements updated based on D2 implementation constraints (Problem 6).
- Source compiles with javac (no IDE dependency).

v0.1.0 — D1 release
- Context of Use model for a calculator-based function.
- Requirements per ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 with unique IDs and explicit assumptions.
- Initial Java implementation with a textual (console) user interface.
